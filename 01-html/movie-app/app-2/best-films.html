    <h1>Best Movies Of All Time</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>"What are the 100 best movies of all time?"</strong> It's a hell
      of a question to ask, and an even harder one to answer. After all, there
      are all kinds of reasons why individual films stand the test of time,
      connecting with viewers on levels both personal and universal. The very
      best exemplars of the form conjure indelible images, evoke overwhelming
      emotions, tell unforgettable stories, and bring us characters who — love
      'em or loathe 'em — we truly believe in. And, let's face it, there's a
      heck of a lot of films out there! Ever since the movies began well over a
      century ago, they have been finding new and ever-edifying ways to, well,
      move us — to joy, to laughter, to fear, to tears, to the edges of our
      seats and to profound experiences that resonate through the years. From
      the misadventures of Peruvian bears to the epic quests of almighty
      fellowships, from painterly whisper-quiet period romances to subversive
      superhero blockbusters, and from awe-inspiring animated adventures to
      singular stories about the human experience hailing from all around the
      world, to try and reach any kind of consensus on the best movies of all
      time is nigh-on impossible.
